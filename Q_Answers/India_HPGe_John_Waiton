HPGe Questions
John Waiton - University of Manchester

- Mention a few other interactions of photons.

Beyond photoelectric absoprtion, the two main processes considered are those of Compton scattering and Pair production in this lab.

- Is there any inorganic scintillator where scintillation photon is coming from atomic transition?

Yes via forbidden region transitions that allow for photons to be emitted. This is allowed via the use of activators or impurities within the detector materials (Thallium in NaI inorganic scintillators)

- Using  data  in  fig  4,  estimate  the  number  of  primary  electrons  reached  in  thephoto-cathode  of  PMT  and  initial  electron-hole  pair  in  HPGe.   Does  the  ratioof these two numbers match with your expectation ?  Assume Width is due toPoisson error only.

Generally I'd say number of primary electrons in the photo-cathode of the PMT would be equivalent to electron-hole pairs (secondary electrons are those produced via multiplication from dynode chain). We can see a peak of 1MeV for the Ge detector, corresponding to 1.6x10^-13 joules, which is approximately 1 million electrons. Assuming a gain of 10^6, we can therefore assume that there is approximately 1 photoelectron for this peak. (I dont think this is correct, but im also not sure if the 60Co spectrum is the correct graph to use for this experiment, and I'm quite tired after getting back from dinner so late, my apologies!)

- What  will be the  energy  resolution  of  an  HPGe detector  if  the detector  size  isincreased by a factor four or reduced by a factor four ?

My understanding is that regardless of the size of the detector, the resolution will not change. This is due to the energy deposits within the detector not depending on how much mass there is, but with the atomic structure with which it is interacting. For example, you could have an atomic-thick layer of germanium, and if (by complete chance) the photon is completely absorbed by the first germanium atom it meets, the resultant free PE will have the equivalent energy required to correspond to the PE peak we expect. In practice this is not the case, but I believe in theory this is true, and the size of the detector should theoretically not have an effect.

- What is the main reason of much better energy resolution of HPGe in comparisonto the scintillator detector?

photoelectron absorption cross section is much higher for HPGe at low energies when comapred to NaI
